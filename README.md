This repository contains the code used to produce the figures in the paper of the same name.

The file chi_square_bound.py produces the graph chi_square_bound.png, and runs nearly instantaneously.

The file simulate_probabilities.py produces the file simulated_probabilities.txt, and takes several minutes to run.

The file plot_simulated_probabilities.py requires the file simulated_probabilities.txt and the file simulate_probabilities.py, and produces the graph projected_separations_plot.png nearly instantaneously.
